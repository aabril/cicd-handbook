# Introduction

> Work-in-progress #wip

This guide aims to support the reader to set up a environment to upload and deploy microservices throught the whole cycle of a continuous-integration and continuous-delivery system. From uploading the code to a git repository to deploying it to a kubernetes cluster with zero downtime.

There might be a few good commercial services offering this solution, althought this guide will have only free and open source tools. 

There is also other tools on the market to deploy microservices like [dokku]() and [captain rover](). These tools are fantastic althought they are focused on quick development, withouth keeping in mind any kubernetes or image registry management, with could be important to deal in professional scenarios. 


## Real use-case 

The goal is to settle the environment as closest as possible to a professional environment, but always minding solo-developers, small communities of developers or little startups to have their environment ready in case they need to scale up, the pathway to a bigger scenario would be the easiest, quickest and painless possible.
